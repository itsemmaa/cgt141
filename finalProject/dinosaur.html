<h2>GETTING STARTED</h2>
<img src="images/dinosaur.JPG">
	<p> This dino's body is worked into all one piece. However, we first start by making the back of the dinosaur. After this, we will make the head, which leads into the neck as one continuous piece. We then crochet the back and neck together to start the body. We will then do limbs, spots, and the tail. <br></p>
	
	
	<h2>BACK</h2>
	<p>In main color:: <br>
	<strong>Round 1:</strong> 6sc in mr [6] <br>
	<strong>Round 2:</strong> *inc* x6 [12] <br>
	<strong>Round 3:</strong> *inc, sc* x6 [18] <br>
	<strong>Round 4:</strong> *inc, 2sc* x6 [24] <br>
	<strong>Round 5:</strong> *inc, 3sc* x6 [30] <br>
	<strong>Round 6:</strong> *inc, 4sc* x6 [36] <br>
	Finish off now. Set the back of the dinosaur aside for now. We will now continue and make the head.
	</p>
	
	<h2>HEAD & BODY</h2>
	<p>In main color:: <br>
	<strong>Round 1:</strong> 6sc in mr [6] <br>
	<strong>Round 2:</strong> *inc* x6 [12] <br>
	<strong>Round 3:</strong> *inc, sc* x6 [18] <br>

	<strong>Round 6:</strong> *inc, 4sc* x6 [36] <br>
	<strong>Round 7:</strong> *inc, 5sc* x6 [42] <br>
	<strong>Round 8-11:</strong> *sc* all around [42] <br>
	In the next round we will add 2 stitch markers. These will mark where to place the safety eyes later. <br>
	<strong>Round 12:</strong> Sc in the next 14 stitches. Sc in the next st and add a stitch marker to the sc just made. Now sc in the next 13 st. Sc in the next st and add a stitch marker to the sc just made. Sc in the next 13 stitches [42] <br>
	<strong>Round 13-15:</strong> *sc* all around [42] <br>
	<strong>Round 16:</strong> sc in the next 12 st. Repeat *dec, 2sc* 6 times. Sc in the next 6 st [36] <br>
	<strong>Round 17:</strong> sc in the next 12 st. Repeat *dec, sc* 6 times. Sc in the next 6 st [30] <br>
	<strong>Round 18:</strong> sc in the next 12 st. Repeat *dec* 6 times. Sc in the next 6 st [24] <br>
	<sub><font color="#fcb6d0">*Add safety eyes in the marked areas from Round 12 now. Stuff the head after. We will now start forming the neck.</font></sub> <br>
	<strong>Round 19-25:</strong> *sc* all around [24] <br>
	<sub><font color="#fcb6d0">*In the next round we will attach the back and neck together. This will form the body.</font></sub> <br>
	<strong>Round 26:</strong> Sc in the next 2 stitches. Be sure to add your stitch marker to that first stitch made in this round. Now line up the back to the dinosaur's next neck stitches (The back parts "wrong" side should be you). Insert your crochet hook under BOTH the neck and body stitches. Sc through both the neck and back st 5 times. Continuing on only the neck, sc in the next 16 st of the next. At this point, we will meet the stitch marker, meaning we completed round 26. <br>
	<sub><font color="#fcb6d0">*Stitch Count: We will have 30 stitches on the back, 6 stitches connecting the neck and body, and 18 neck stitches</font></sub> <br>
	<strong>Round 27:</strong> Sc in the next 2 st. Now we meet the back. Sc in the next 30 st of the back. Now we're working on the neck, sc in the next 16 st. [48] <br>

	<h4>About Us</h4>
		<p>I am a 19 year old college student, and this is my first ever website. I made this site <br> from scratch with html and css. I decided to make this site to teach people that learning something new doesn't <br>have to be scary or intimidating. It can be hard to know where to look when you are first starting to learn. <br> Hopefully, this website helps at least a couple people try something knew.</p>
